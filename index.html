                    Well, every musician has been there.<br>
                    Before you’ve been in a few bands, creating one is an intimidating thought. You have no idea how to
                    get the right people on-board or get the gigs you need.<br>

                    Before the development of the electronic keyboard, the configuration was typically two guitarists (a
                    lead guitarist and a rhythm guitarist, with one of them singing lead vocals), a bassist, and a
                    drummer (e.g. The Beatles, KISS, Metallica).<br>
                    Another common formation is a vocalist who does not play an instrument, electric guitarist, bass
                    guitarist, and a drummer (e.g. The Who, The Monkees, Led Zeppelin, Queen, and U2). Instrumentally,
                    these bands can be considered as trios.<br>

                    The first thing you need to start a band? The members of the band.<br>

                        The person responsible for keeping beat and band in line. Without a drummer, the band is lost. A
                        drummer is someone who gets a lot of stereotypes. People assume that Drummers are dumb people
                        with no musical talent. When in reality, drums are the backbone of most music. Drummers keep
                        time and keep the beat going. Drummers also do have a lot of musical talent. It takes a lot of
                        coordination to be a good drummer. They also have to be able to feel the music. Without this
                        godlike creature there would be no rythem to the music and havoc would occur.<br>

                        The main job is to translate the languages between the Guitarist and the Drummer, for they speak
                        two totally different languages. Without him/her any rock band is no more. They usually use a
                        combonation of fingers. Slapping/popping,and picking to get their orgasmic sound that makes the
                        crowd jump! Along with the Drummer the Bassist is the sexiest member of the group and thereby
                        usually ends up with the most groupies...

                            alt="wiki definition">Electric Guitar</a>. A true guitarist is someone who looks at their
                        instrument as though it were a paintbrush preloaded with every color imaginable and then some,
                        waiting to spill onto the canvas known as sound in an array of both erratic and delicate
                        displays. These displays differ depending on the guitarist's motivation and state of mind, as
                        well as their life experiences and musical inspirations. The way to tell if someone is a
                        guitarist is their ability to tell a story through their playing in a style that is distinctly

                <p class=par>
                    The next step is to figure out what your “sound” will be.<br>
                    This happens naturally over time, of course. But you can get a pretty good idea from the beginning
                    if you’re intentional about it.<br>
                    At your first band meeting, talk about your influences. Who are your favorite artists? What’ve you
                    all been listening to recently? Are there any genres that you have in-common?<br>
                    Your sound is likely going to be somewhere in-between those answers.<br>
                    Make sure to check out any songs that your members have already written. What genre do they tend to
                    write in?<br>
                    Finally, jam a little bit. What sound organically comes up? You’ll want to write in a genre that
                    feels most natural to all your bandmates.<br>
                    One important thing: make sure to pick a genre that your singer can sing well.<br>
                    All instrumentalists can change their style and their gear with time. But singers have only one
                    piece of gear – their voices.<br>
                    So make sure to pick something that sounds good with what is arguably the most important part of
                    every song!<br>

                    This is the exciting part. There’s nothing better than the artistic expression of creating something
                    entirely new.<br>
                    Go wild. Be as creative as you want. Before you start, though…<br>
                    Learn a few covers. It may sound boring, but it’s important. You want to make sure your group has
                    learned to play well together before you start writing. It will make the entire process ten times
                    easier.<br>
                    Once you’ve learned to play nicely together, really dive into the writing process. To headline a
                    show, you’ll need around twelve songs at least. That should be your goal at first. But don’t
                    sacrifice quality for quantity. It’s more important to have six amazing songs than twelve average
                    ones. Take your time. You can always play opening gigs (or covers) until you’ve written the amount
                    you need.<br>
